# What's the fuss? Let them pay you!

How come only stores accept debit/credit cards? You should be able
to accept them too. Let your friends send you some money, or charge
for impromptu consulting. Just deploy this app to Heroku, change some
variables and you're in business.

This thing doesn't ask the customer much, just for an email
and the payment amount. All the credit card info stays on
[Stripe](https://stripe.com) so you have nothing to worry about.
